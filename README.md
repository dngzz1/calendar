# Calendar Event Width

Given a vector of intervals (start and finish time) representing meetings to be displayed on google calendar, compute the width of the div to be displayed (which should be the reciprocal of `max_overlap`).

```rust
let meetings = vec![(1., 3.), (4., 6.), (5., 9.), (10., 12.)];
    let max_overlap = solve_max_overlap(&meetings);
    println!("Checking meetings {:?}...", meetings);
    for i in 0..meetings.len() {
        println!(
            "Meeting {:?} has max overlap of {}",
            meetings[i], max_overlap[i]
        );
    }
```

Terminal:

```terminal
‚ùØ cargo run

Meeting (4.0, 6.0) has max overlap of 2
Meeting (5.0, 9.0) has max overlap of 2

```
